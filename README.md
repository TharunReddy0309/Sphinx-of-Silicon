## 🚀 Quick Start
### 1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sphinx-riddle-game.git
    cd sphinx-riddle-game
2. Set up a virtual environment:

    python -m venv venv
    # Linux/Mac
    source venv/bin/activate
    # Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Add your API key:
    Create a .env file in the project root:
    groqai=your_api_key_here
5. Run the game:

    streamlit run game.py
    Open your browser → http://localhost:8501

🧮 How Hints Work
A linear regression model decides how big a hint you get:

Difficulty Score	What You See
    < 30	🪄 Small hint
    30–65	🔑 Medium hint
    65–80	🚪 Big hint
    > 80	💀 Full answer revealed → You lose!

The more riddles you solve and the more hints you request, the tougher it gets.
